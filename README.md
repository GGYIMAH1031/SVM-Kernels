# SVM-Kernels
Goal of this project is to implement perceptron,Dual perceptron,Linear Kernel and RBF kernel without using any Machine Learning Libraries

# Perceptron and Dual Perceptron

1. I Implemented the perceptron algorithm and dual perceptron algorithm on PerceptronData dataset
and ran ten fold cross-validation and then compared the performance of the two algorithms on the
PerceptronData dataset and made sure that they have (almost) identical performance.

#  Kernelizing Dual Perceptron

1. I implemented dual perceptron with the linear kernel on the Two Spiral dataset and showed that the
data is not separable using ten-fold cross validation.

# Radial Basis Function Kernel (RBF kernel)/ Gaussian kernel

1. I implemented dual perceptron with RBF kernel on the Two Spiral dataset and
showed that the data is separable using ten-fold cross validation.

About dataset:

• PerceptronData: This is a binary classification dataset consisting of four features and the
classes are linearly separable.
• Two Spirals: This dataset has two features and it is non-linearly separable
